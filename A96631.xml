            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Yeſterday, being Friday, was the firſt day that we met with my Lord Generall with all his Forces, and our five Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: We met upon a place called <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Greene,</hi> where was a gallant ſhow both of Horſe and Foot, with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary great rejoycing: And indeed my Lord Generall hath a gallant and ſtately Army of Horſe, which amounteth to the number of ſix thouſand compleat, and more Foot, ſo that upon our Muſter wee were conceived to be betwixt ſixteene or ſeventeene thouſand at the leaſt, beſides a brave traine of good Artillery. It is not in my power or ability to expreſſe the triumphant rejoycing and ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raordinary ſhouting that was expreſſed at the time of our meeting. And now my Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152479:3"/> and his Army are marching on the one ſide, and we on the other ſide of the Countrey, but not ſo farre diſtant one from another, but that we are alwaies within two miles one of another at night.</p>
            <p>Upon our march yeſterday there came newes throughout to all our ſeverall Companies in the Armies, that the ſiege is raiſed before <hi>Exeter</hi> for certaine: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Gloceſter</hi> is in very good condition, for they have fired the enemies Salleries, and ſcattered their foot in abundance, inſomuch that it is as much as the horſe can doe to keepe up the foot to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſiege, leſt they ſhould runne away. Theſe are the very words that the Meſſenger related concerning theſe two places.</p>
            <p>At this preſent we are in Oxfordſhire, ſome fifty miles from <hi>London,</hi> but do not know certainly whether we ſhall march for <hi>Oxford</hi> or no; but we hope we ſhall forthwith haſten for <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>

            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152479:4"/>
            <p>We have already coaſted all Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire round, and I thinke ſo we ſhall doe all the other Countries as we goe; for though as yet we are but about ſome fifty miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> we have marched at leaſt threeſcore and tenne miles, for wee cannot march directly ſtraight forward; but yet nevertheleſſe, thankes be to God, our enemies doe flye before us whereſoever we come.</p>
            <p>This day it is ſuppoſed that my Lord Generall will ſet upon <hi>Banbury,</hi> for we are not above five miles from it.</p>
            <p>We have not layd ſtill but one day ſince we came forth, ſo that if farre tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and hard fare, and no lodging would make us Gentlemen, then we ſhould be Gentlemen preſently. But the Lord be praiſed we take comfort in it. We hope to ſee <hi>Gloceſter</hi> by the next Tueſday at night, and are very confident through the ayd and aſſiſtance of Almighty God) to raiſe the Siege with a great deale of courage.</p>
